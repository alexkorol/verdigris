## 2026-07-12 — Add a real Escape game menu

- Goal: replace Escape's close-only behavior with an intentional in-game menu
  while preserving it as the back key for open panels.
- Implementation: Escape now closes the active overlay, side panel, or expanded
  chat first, then opens a centered Game Menu when the playfield is clear. The
  menu exposes Resume, Character, Inventory, Quests, Skill Tree, Settings, and a
  save-aware Log Out route, with visible hotkey labels and responsive layout.
- Proof added: unit coverage locks the menu inventory and Escape ordering;
  browser smoke opens the menu, switches into Settings, backs out, reopens it,
  and resumes. A live in-app browser pass also verified the rendered hierarchy,
  panel replacement, Escape back behavior, and Resume return to the canvas.
- Evidence: `npm run test:unit` — 84 files and 532 tests; `npm run lint` — exit
  0; `npm run smoke:browser` — production build and 2/2 browser tests; `npm run
  playtest` — 21/21 scenarios with session critic 100/100.
- Next target: let the user exercise the revised menu in the running dev build.

## 2026-07-12 — Archive completed plans and historical review notes

- Goal: keep current documentation from presenting superseded implementation
  plans and pre-migration code review findings as active work.
- Implementation: moved the July fix plan, movement plan, dependency plan, and
  February code review into `docs/archive/`, added an explicit historical-status
  header to each, and updated the live vision document's two plan references.
- Evidence: `npm run test:unit` — 83 files and 530 tests; `npm run lint` — exit 0.
- Next target: final audit, clean-tree verification, and a fresh end-to-end gate.

## 2026-07-12 — Remove archived dependencies and duplicate runtime paths

- Goal: keep one documented production configuration and eliminate dependencies
  and binaries that the current scripts cannot use.
- Audit result: `node_modules_old` contained two tracked Windows binaries totaling
  about 12.6 MB; `ecosystem.config.js` duplicated the documented `.cjs` PM2 file;
  HANDOFF described a superseded June session; the ignored build directory was
  stale; two HTTPS middleware packages ran back to back; and
  `start-server-and-test` had no script consumer.
- Implementation: deleted and ignored `node_modules_old`, removed the duplicate
  config, stale handoff, and local build output, retained `express-sslify` as the
  single proxy-aware HTTPS redirect, uninstalled `ssl-express-www` and the unused
  test helper, and removed the no-op authentication logout call while keeping the
  authoritative local save on disconnect.
- Evidence: `npm run test:unit` — 83 files and 530 tests; `npm run lint` — exit
  0; `npm run playtest` — 21/21 scenarios with session critic 100/100.
- Next target: archive clearly completed planning/review documents and perform a
  final requirement-by-requirement audit.

## 2026-07-12 — Delete verified dead art and font files

- Goal: remove binary assets that no runtime loader, server item, README, or
  document can resolve.
- Audit result: two obsolete cursor images, two unloaded fonts, an unused legacy
  tilesheet, an unsupported edible sheet, four art-selection candidates, and
  three detached GitHub presentation files had no references. Dynamic item art
  outside the named candidate files was deliberately retained.
- Implementation: deleted the thirteen verified dead assets, removing roughly
  3 MB from the checked-out source tree without changing the DCSS-derived live
  terrain, object, monster, or item sheets.
- Evidence: `npm run test:unit` — 83 files and 530 tests; `npm run lint` — exit
  0; `npm run smoke:browser` — production build and 2/2 browser tests.
- Next target: untrack the archived dependency binaries and prune duplicate root
  config plus redundant dependencies.

## 2026-07-12 — Make every retained game pane reachable

- Goal: remove pane registry entries that could not be reached through the live
  shell and expose the useful overlays through visible controls.
- Audit result: Equipment duplicated the ragdoll already mounted inside
  Inventory, while Friends showed inert Add/Remove buttons. Quests had only a
  keyboard shortcut; Settings and Logout had no visible route.
- Implementation: deleted the duplicate Equipment and unfinished Friends panes,
  removed their registry and legacy slot mappings, and added visible Quests,
  Settings, and Exit controls to the in-game menu cluster. The bank's old
  `show-sidebar` bridge is now explicitly limited to opening Inventory.
- Proof added: HUD source regression coverage requires all three menu routes and
  verifies the two retired pane files and imports remain absent.
- Evidence: `npm run test:unit` — 83 files and 530 tests; `npm run lint` — exit
  0; `npm run smoke:browser` — production build and 2/2 browser tests.
- Next target: remove verified dead binary assets and repository/config cruft.

## 2026-07-12 — Remove detached identity and UI protocols

- Goal: delete verified unreachable APIs, socket events, and UI signals while
  preserving compatibility at save boundaries.
- Audit result: the retired character-creation flow was the only consumer of
  asynchronous name moderation; the smelt pane protocol and two resource
  listeners had no counterpart; five client bus events had no listeners; and
  the container panel exposed only placeholder text.
- Implementation: removed the name-validation routes, service, tests, and
  obsolete operational document; retired the empty JSON identity migration;
  removed Axios as a direct dependency; deleted the dead smelt pipeline and
  no-listener bus emissions; hid ContainerStack without deleting its component;
  and removed the retired quiver image. Pre-quiver save scrubbing remains with
  explicit compatibility comments.
- Proof added: inventory wiring now asserts that the placeholder container panel
  is not mounted. Existing identity, inventory, server-boot, and Chronicle tests
  cover the retained paths.
- Evidence: `npm run test:unit` — 83 files and 530 tests; `npm run lint` — exit
  0; `npm run smoke:browser` — production build and 2/2 browser tests; `npm run
  playtest` — 21/21 scenarios with session critic 100/100.
- Next target: make every retained pane reachable and remove the two superseded
  duplicate panes.

## 2026-07-11 — Keep account persistence local

- Goal: remove the archived website POST path so local accounts persist on the
  same machine as their credentials and Chronicle data.
- Root cause: a `local:` login token still routed autosaves through an Axios
  repository using the obsolete `SITE_URL`, making saves depend on an unrelated
  service that is not part of the current game.
- Implementation: local login profiles now update the SQLite identity registry,
  Chronicle scions continue to save with their House, and guest or retired-token
  profiles use the local JSON snapshot store. The remote repository and its
  `SITE_URL` configuration were removed, and development setup now documents the
  actual HTTP/WebSocket port and local persistence boundaries.
- Proof added: registry tests verify profile changes survive without allowing a
  snapshot to replace account identity; persistence tests cover local accounts,
  guests, retired tokens, throttling, and error propagation.
- Evidence: `npm run test:unit` — 84 files and 549 tests; `npm run lint` — exit
  0; `npm run playtest` — 21/21 scenarios with session critic 100/100.
- Next target: remove the unreachable account-name moderation backend and its
  remaining Axios dependency.

## 2026-07-11 — Reset the shared player fixture to level-one progression

- Goal: stop fresh guests and local-account fallbacks from inheriting hidden
  endgame gathering progress and a preloaded bank.
- Root cause: the shared player fixture still carried Mining 82, Smithing 52,
  35,000 banked coins, ores, a bronze bar, and three unused timestamp/origin
  fields even though the visible starter inventory had already been cleaned.
- Implementation: the fixture now starts every skill at level 1 with zero XP,
  has an empty bank, retains only the intended pickaxe and 100 carried coins,
  and no longer carries `x_ORIG`, `y_ORIG`, or `sign_in`.
- Proof added: constructing a real Player from the fresh fixture must produce an
  empty bank, six baseline skills, and exactly the intended starter item ids.
  While verifying, `session-arc` exposed a pre-existing completion race; it now
  synchronizes on an authoritative empty floor and the real instance-complete
  event before checking the quest transition.
- Evidence: `npm run test:unit` — 84 files and 547 tests; `npm run lint` — exit
  0; `npm run playtest` — 21/21 scenarios with session critic 100/100.
- Next target: replace the dead remote account POST with authoritative local
  persistence and remove its obsolete SITE_URL configuration.

## 2026-07-11 — Remove the final detached socket and tree modules

- Goal: extend the legacy audit from visible components into low-reference
  server/client modules without mistaking alias imports or Vite globs for dead
  code.
- Audit result: monster rarity, ECS AI, player persistence, foreground data,
  context actions, and dynamic pane/grid modules are all live and were retained.
  `server/player/player-socket.js` had no importer and only a commented-out
  constructor reference; `FlowerOfLifeTree.vue` became detached when its
  superseded parent pane was removed.
- Implementation: deleted the unused per-player socket wrapper and old SVG tree
  child, removed the commented socket-construction remnant, and renamed the
  cleanup regression from UI-specific to module-wide coverage. Live sockets use
  the central `Socket` service; the active tree remains
  `GeometricSkillTreePane` backed by the Flower-of-Life data/stat engine.
- Proof added: the module cleanup spec covers both deleted modules alongside the
  live replacements, and the focused server boot test passed before the full
  gates.
- Evidence: `npm run test:unit` — 84 files and 546 tests; `npm run lint` — exit
  0; `npm run smoke:browser` — production build and 2/2 browser tests; `npm run
  playtest` — 21/21 scenarios with session critic 100/100.
- Next target: perform a requirement-by-requirement completion audit of the
  House gold, shop, inventory, legacy cleanup, Git sync, and live-server goals.

## 2026-07-11 — Remove orphaned parallel UI implementations

- Goal: finish the source-graph portion of the legacy UI audit by removing
  single-reference components only after accounting for Vite's dynamic loaders.
- Audit result: game panes and utility grids that initially looked orphaned are
  live through `import.meta.glob` and were retained. Four components outside
  those globs had no importer, renderer, or registry entry: the old `Info`
  health strip, the unused `FloatingWindow` prototype, the superseded
  `FlowerOfLifePane`, and an account-ID `CharacterCreate` form bypassed by the
  Chronicles House/scion flow.
- Implementation: deleted those four unreachable Vue components. Their live
  replacements remain `GameHUD`, `PaneHost`, `GeometricSkillTreePane`, and the
  `ChroniclesScreen` create-scion form. The Flower-of-Life data and stat engine
  remain in use and were not removed.
- Proof added: a legacy UI regression spec verifies all four live replacements
  and asserts that the retired parallel component files no longer exist.
- Evidence: `npm run test:unit` — 84 files and 546 tests; `npm run lint` — exit
  0; `npm run smoke:browser` — production build and 2/2 browser tests; `npm run
  playtest` — 21/21 scenarios with session critic 100/100.
- Next target: audit server/client event names and old action comments for dead
  protocols, keeping compatibility handlers only where persisted or deployed
  clients still require them.

## 2026-07-11 — Delete the unreachable legacy pane shell

- Goal: remove another proven-dead UI layer without changing any live pane or
  preserving an obsolete parallel navigation system.
- Audit result: `src/components/Slots.vue` implemented the old white/grey
  seven-tab strip, but no source file imported or rendered it. The live client
  registers panes in `Delaford.vue` and renders them through
  `GameContainer -> PaneHost`. Seven tab SVGs were referenced only by the dead
  component.
- Implementation: deleted the unused tab-strip component and its private SVG
  icon set. The active Stats, Inventory, Equipment, Friends, Settings, Logout,
  and Quests pane components remain registered in the live pane host.
- Proof added: the HUD unit suite asserts that `Delaford.vue` mounts
  `GameContainer` with the pane registry and that the retired `Slots.vue` shell
  does not exist.
- Evidence: `npm run test:unit` — 83 files and 545 tests; `npm run lint` — exit
  0; `npm run smoke:browser` — production build and 2/2 browser tests; `npm run
  playtest` — 21/21 scenarios with session critic 100/100.
- Next target: audit the zero-reference legacy item-grid, anvil-grid, and shop
  components against the current inventory, forge, and shop implementations.

## 2026-07-11 — Remove the retired quiver slot

- Goal: remove the unexplained quiver-shaped slot from the equipment ragdoll
  without disturbing the available DCSS item and monster art library.
- Audit result: no item catalogue entry, equip handler, combat rule, or character
  sheet supports arrows or a quiver. Server hydration and both persistence paths
  already discard the legacy `arrows` wear key. The only live remnant was a
  decorative, non-interactive fake slot and its CSS in the client ragdoll.
- Implementation: removed the fake arrows descriptor, rendered slot, and legacy
  slot styling. The stale-save filters remain intentionally at persistence
  boundaries so old snapshots continue to load safely; the general
  `quiver_rawhide` inventory art remains available with the other source art.
- Proof added: inventory component wiring now asserts that the live equipment
  ragdoll contains no arrows or quiver surface while retaining the real feet
  equipment slot. Existing stale-wear coverage proves old `arrows` keys are
  still discarded.
- Evidence: `npm run test:unit` — 83 files and 544 tests; `npm run lint` — exit
  0; `npm run smoke:browser` — production build and 2/2 browser tests; `npm run
  playtest` — 21/21 scenarios with session critic 100/100.
- Next target: inspect pane registrations and duplicate inventory/wear entry
  points for unreachable legacy UI before removing another bounded slice.

## 2026-07-11 — Normalize small armor inventory footprints

- Goal: make every helm, glove, and boot occupy a consistent 2×2 inventory
  footprint, including items loaded from old persisted snapshots.
- Root cause: the shared equipment defaults still assigned gloves and feet a
  2×1 footprint. Explicit legacy `size` metadata was accepted before equipment
  slot rules, so stale records could also preserve the narrow shape on both the
  server and client.
- Implementation: head, glove, and foot equipment slots are now authoritative
  2×2 shapes across item creation, persisted-inventory repacking, and client
  normalization. Equipment-slot aliases are recognized after an inventory item
  replaces its catalogue slot with a numeric grid position.
- Proof added: the inventory unit suite checks every matching wearable catalogue
  item plus a legacy 2×1 boot record. The live town scenario grants a bronze
  helm, gloves, and boots through the real inventory pipeline and observes each
  authoritative 2×2 size.
- Evidence: `npm run test:unit` — 83 files and 544 tests; `npm run lint` — exit
  0; `npm run smoke:browser` — production build and 2/2 browser tests; `npm run
  playtest` — 21/21 scenarios.
- Next target: continue the legacy cleanup audit, starting with the obsolete
  quiver presentation and unreachable pane registrations.

## 2026-07-11 — Connect scion gold to House development and clarify shops

- Goal: let a newly founded House grow from gold found by its active scion, and
  make basic purchasing predictable without replacing the existing DCSS item art.
- Root cause: House treasury had no transfer event or in-game control. It could
  only receive daily stipends and depth-record rewards, so depositing carried
  coins was impossible. Shop tiles hid prices and made the primary click appraise
  an item, leaving buying behind quantity context menus.
- Implementation: Rhea, House Banker is stationary in Delaford. Her bank pane
  shows carried gold beside the active House treasury and offers `Deposit 100`
  and `Deposit all`. The repository commits the reduced scion snapshot and
  increased treasury in one SQLite transaction, validates living-scion House
  ownership, and refreshes both balances. Shop stock keeps its current DCSS tile,
  adds the authoritative coin price, buys one on left click, retains right-click
  quantities, and reports exact buy/sell totals. Successful trades are marked for
  persistence. Full-message socket payloads now work for bank and shop openings;
  development teleports advance their movement sequence so browsers accept them.
- Proof added: `house-treasury` uses the real banker action, deposits 100 gold,
  checks both balances, reconnects, and proves neither balance can be duplicated.
  Repository and handler specs cover atomic persistence, ownership, proximity,
  full socket envelopes, buy-one, stack quantities, and transaction messages.
- Evidence: `npm run playtest` — 21/21 scenarios with session critic 100/100;
  `npm run test:unit` — 83 files and 542 tests; `npm run lint` — exit 0; `npm
  run smoke:browser` — 2/2.
- Next target: give the House improvements concrete in-run benefits, beginning
  with one small Great Hall or House Forge effect surfaced in the Chronicles UI.

## 2026-07-11 — Close the endless-descent stakes audit

- Goal: verify that looking at and advancing the recorded depth now changes
  both danger and reward through live gameplay, without duplicating systems.
- Audit result: the ladder already raises monster levels by two per floor and
  scales health, damage, experience, coins, completion rewards, treasure base
  pools, and guaranteed treasure item level. The encounter pass adds a rising
  rare share (12% on floor 1 toward a 30% cap), so deeper packs contain more
  Thick Hide and Frenzied enemies. `bestDepth` is persisted for the scion.
- Existing proof: `instance-balance` measures increasing average health and
  damage at depths 1, 3, 6, and 10 and proves a fresh build reaches a lethal
  wall. `depth-loot` descends through real stairs and observes guaranteed gear
  rise from item level 10 to 50 by floor 5; `chronicles` observes the depth
  record, and `session-arc` reaches a visible level wall before choosing run two.
- Evidence: `npm run playtest` — 20/20 scenarios with session critic 100/100;
  `npm run test:unit` — 82 files and 536 tests; `npm run lint` — exit 0; `npm
  run smoke:browser` — 2/2.
- Next target: nested containers are the clearest remaining expansion; start
  with a small server-owned bag contract and add UI only after persistence and
  stale-snapshot behavior are specified.

## 2026-07-11 — Differentiate biome encounters and rare monsters

- Goal: make biome packs demand visibly different responses and give rare
  enemies explicit, depth-scaled stakes.
- Implementation: biome-specific role profiles now vary melee, ranged, and
  support composition. Buffer monsters project a short-range 12% damage aura,
  while rare monsters can roll Thick Hide (+20% health) or Frenzied (12% faster
  attacks). Rare odds rise with depth and rare kills retain their higher gear
  chance while awarding 1.35x experience. Empty scenes skip aura work entirely.
- Proof added: `encounter-variety` observes crypt and marsh role differences,
  a live support aura, an explicit rare modifier, and a killable empowered
  depth-10 target through the real server. Unit coverage verifies aura lifecycle,
  dormant-scene behavior, role profiles, modifier math, rising rare share, and
  measured pack survivability through the combat pipeline.
- Evidence: `npm run playtest` — 20/20 scenarios with session critic 100/100;
  `npm run test:unit` — 82 files and 536 tests; `npm run lint` — exit 0; `npm
  run smoke:browser` — 2/2.
- Next target: audit the existing endless-descent risk/reward ladder before
  adding another subsystem.

## 2026-07-11 — Surface one real Vesselforge choice in town

- Goal: expose the highest-value missing Vesselforge interaction without
  changing the existing crafting engine.
- Implementation: in Delaford, right-clicking a vessel item with patience and
  an open slot now offers `Add a random brand (100 coins)`. The server validates
  town location, exact owned item UUID, capacity, patience, and funds; it then
  calls the existing `sear` operation, spends exactly 100 coins, refreshes the
  vessel tooltip/combat projection, and marks the scion dirty for persistence.
  Out-of-town and invalid direct requests fail without mutation.
- Harness/browser support: the harness can now build the real server-authored
  inventory context menu, and deterministic dev grants accept seed/item level.
  The new `vesselforge-brand` scenario proves discovery, stated cost, mutation,
  payment, and refreshed tooltip lines. Browser resilience returns from the
  quick-start instance to town, adds a brand through the visible context menu,
  sees the new tooltip line, then drags the crafted pike into main hand.
- Evidence: focused Vesselforge/context coverage — 4 files and 47 tests; `npm
  run playtest` — 19/19 scenarios, session critic 100/100; `npm run test:unit`
  — 81 files and 531 tests; `npm run lint` — exit 0; `npm run smoke:browser`
  — 2/2; browser resilience — 3/3.
- Next target: audit encounter and descent tracks against current rare-tier,
  biome-boss, and depth-reward code before adding anything else.

## 2026-07-11 — Verify July 4 inventory remainders live

- Goal: check the July 4 fix-plan's drag-to-equip and floating tooltip claims
  against current code and the actual browser/server path.
- Audit result: both were already implemented in commit `2dddfea`; no duplicate
  production change was needed. Pointer drag resolves a paperdoll target and
  emits the same authoritative equip commit as other inventory paths. The
  floating ornate tooltip renders rarity-colored headers, live combat values,
  vessel lines and pips, attunement, relic names, and viewport-aware placement.
- Live proof: the dedicated browser resilience spec granted a generated Bronze
  Pike, verified its WIZARD art and vessel material lines, dragged it onto the
  main-hand slot, and observed the server-refreshed equipped art/name. It also
  asserted no client handler or uncaught errors.
- Evidence: `npm run build` — exit 0; `npx playwright test
  tests/e2e/browser-reconnect.spec.mjs` — 3/3 passed, including the real
  tooltip/drag/equip case.
- Next target: relic circulation is already scenario-backed in `chronicles` and
  `session-arc`; audit and surface the highest-value missing Vesselforge player
  interaction.

## 2026-07-11 — Tolerate stale Chronicle player snapshots

- Goal: prove renamed ids and malformed old snapshot fields cannot prevent a
  Chronicle scion from loading.
- Failing proof: a non-object `inventory` reached `.map`, and missing/null skill
  entries reached the Player constructor's level reconciliation unchecked.
- Implementation: the loader rebuilds the six canonical skills from safe XP,
  defaults malformed bank/friend data, discards malformed inventory entries,
  and preserves unknown-but-structured item ids as inert possessions with no
  actions. Existing wear and passive-tree validators clear renamed ids.
- Regression proof: a fuzzed old snapshot with renamed skills, inventory,
  wear, and tree ids constructs a real Player; focused specs also prove valid
  inventory siblings survive. The full suite initially caught an overly
  destructive unknown-item policy, so opaque legacy records are retained.
- Evidence: focused stale/schema coverage — 5 files and 32 tests; `npm run
  playtest` — 18/18 scenarios with session critic 100/100; `npm run test:unit`
  — 80 files and 528 tests; `npm run lint` — exit 0.
- Next target: verify the July 4 drag-to-equip and floating vessel tooltip
  claims against the live client and close any remaining proof gap.

## 2026-07-11 — Contain malformed actions and instance broadcasts

- Goal: exercise hostile context-menu input and audit broadcasts for state
  leaking between independent scenes.
- Bugs found: `player:context-menu:action` dereferenced an assumed nested item
  shape before validation, and equip/unequip notifications omitted recipients,
  sending one scion's complete refreshed state to every connected client.
- Implementation: malformed action envelopes now fail closed before creating an
  `Action`; valid actions also require a socket-bound player. Equip and unequip
  updates now target only players in the acting scion's current scene, including
  paperdoll-to-world drops.
- Regression proof: context-menu specs cover four malformed shapes; equipment
  specs require explicit scene recipients for equip, backpack unequip, and
  world-drop unequip.
- Evidence: focused authorization/context/equipment run — 4 files and 30 tests;
  `npm run playtest` — 18/18 scenarios; `npm run test:unit` — 79 files and 525
  tests; `npm run lint` — exit 0.
- Next target: fuzz stale Chronicle snapshots through the real Player loader,
  especially malformed skills and inventory records.

## 2026-07-10 — Finish development account registration

- Goal: finish and isolate the existing landing/auth restyle and make local
  account creation work when Vite and the authoritative server use different
  ports.
- Review result: the presentation changes were complete, but cross-port
  routing and the development CORS allowlist had no focused regression proof.
- Implementation: registration derives its HTTP endpoint from the selected
  WebSocket server, returns safely to same-origin for unavailable/malformed
  sockets, and development CORS accepts only the same host (including loopback
  aliases) on Vite port 5173. The landing and registration panels have wider,
  clearer spacing and a distinct primary registration action.
- Proof added: unit coverage exercises ws/wss/fallback endpoint routing and
  rejects hostile origins and wrong ports. Browser smoke now creates a real
  local account and verifies that sign-in receives the username with a blank
  password and guest mode disabled.
- Evidence: focused registration/server specs — 3 files and 8 tests passed;
  touched-file ESLint — exit 0; `npm run smoke:browser` — 2/2 passed.
- Next target: audit the robustness checklist for full-message payload mistakes,
  cross-instance broadcasts, and stale persisted-data failures.

## 2026-07-10 — Stabilize the session-arc baseline

- Goal: restore a green baseline before beginning the Tier 0 critic work.
- Failing scenario: the full `npm run playtest` run timed out at
  `session-arc` while waiting to descend beyond floor 1.
- Cause: frequent `dev:state` polling exhausted the same development
  rate-limit bucket as `dev:teleport`, so the stair control command could be
  dropped before the party transition.
- Acceptance coverage: `ws-message-handler.spec.js` now exhausts diagnostic
  reads and asserts that a harness teleport is still dispatched.
- Implementation: diagnostic reads and harness control commands use separate
  development-only token buckets.
- Evidence: `npm run playtest` — 13/13 scenarios; `npm run test:unit` — 73
  files and 503 tests; `npm run lint` — exit 0.
- Critic score: 3/5 (qualitative until the Tier 0 scorer lands). The arc has
  meaningful gear and tree consequences and reaches combat quickly, but its
  timings and choices are not yet emitted as trendable metrics.
- Next target: add the Tier 0 session-arc metrics block and automatic journal
  recording.

## 2026-07-10 — Add a scored session-arc critic

- Goal: make the session-arc critic emit trendable measurements instead of a
  pass/fail result alone.
- Failing scenario: `session-arc` completed its gameplay assertions, then
  failed with `recordMetrics is not a function` at the new acceptance boundary.
- Scenario added: the arc measures seconds to first combat and first drop,
  real level-1 and level-5 kill times, successful tree/equipment/zone choices,
  deaths, and maximum depth.
- Implementation: the playtest runner validates and prints a JSON metrics
  block, calculates a five-axis 0–100 critic score, and appends each run to the
  trend table below. Incomplete or negative measurements are rejected.
- Evidence: `npm run playtest` — 13/13 scenarios; `npm run test:unit` — 74
  files and 505 tests; `npm run lint` — exit 0.
- Critic score: 100/100. Final gate sample: first combat 0.59s, first drop
  0.74s, level-1 TTK 1.89s, level-5 TTK 0.62s, 6 meaningful choices, 0
  deaths, depth 4.
- Next target: automate the four browser blind-spot checks from Tier 0.

## 2026-07-10 — Close the client browser blind spot

- Goal: automate the four canonical client checks and make them a repeatable
  gate for client-touching changes.
- Failing scenario: the new browser smoke completed movement-after-UI-click
  and canvas context-menu checks, then failed because right-clicking the modern
  Bronze Pickaxe inventory tile produced no `#actions` menu.
- Scenario added: `browser-smoke.spec.mjs` drives a real built client and
  server, proving WASD after an Adventure-button click, canvas and inventory
  context menus, tree allocation across close/reopen, and the Verdant Grove
  minimap label.
- Implementation: modern inventory tiles now emit the same server-authored
  `PLAYER:MENU` request as legacy item grids. `npm run smoke:browser` builds the
  client and runs the dedicated Playwright gate.
- Evidence: `npm run smoke:browser` — 1/1; `npm run playtest` — 13/13;
  `npm run test:unit` — 74 files and 505 tests; `npm run lint` — exit 0.
- Critic score: 100/100. Final session sample: first combat 0.59s, first drop
  0.75s, level-1 TTK 0.62s, level-5 TTK 0.01s, 6 meaningful choices, 0
  deaths, depth 4.
- Next target: Tier 1 gear-outcome scenario measuring unarmed, looted weapon,
  and higher-ilvl vessel TTK margins.

## 2026-07-10 — Make gear change combat outcomes

- Goal: prove strict same-monster TTK improvements from unarmed combat to a
  looted weapon and then to a higher-ilvl Vesselforge drop.
- Failing scenario: `gear-outcomes` first lacked an exact-monster reset, then
  showed the core defect directly: ilvl 5 and ilvl 65 vessels both produced 22
  authoritative slash attack.
- Scenario added: one seeded battleaxe base is dropped at ilvl 5 and 65; one
  exact 140-HP monster is restored between all three real combat trials. The
  scenario requires explicit attack and TTK margins.
- Implementation: Vesselforge material and brand damage now contributes a
  per-hit bonus to the base item's dominant physical style. Dev-only setup can
  seed item drops and restore one monster without regenerating the floor.
- Evidence: `npm run playtest` — 14/14; `npm run test:unit` — 74 files and 506
  tests; `npm run lint` — exit 0. The three required balance specs plus
  `vesselforge.spec.js` passed 43/43.
- Outcome: full-gate gear trial measured 10.17s unarmed, 2.61s with the ilvl-5
  vessel, and 2.12s with the ilvl-65 vessel; slash attack rose 33 → 39.
- Critic score: 100/100. Session-arc remained at first combat 0.58s, first
  drop 0.76s, 6 meaningful choices, 0 deaths, and depth 4.
- Next target: Tier 1 build-divergence scenario comparing STR melee and INT
  skill combat profiles at equal level and point spend.

## 2026-07-10 — Prove equal-point builds diverge

- Goal: compare equal-level, equal-spend STR and INT scions against the same
  pack and prove distinct melee and mana-skill profiles.
- Scenario result: the new scenario passed before production changes, proving
  this item was already implemented but lacked a goal-harness contract. Two
  level-20 party members spend exactly 20 points down opposite tree axes and
  strike one exact reset monster.
- Evidence: the full run measured STR 83 vs 20 and INT 83 vs 11; STR melee won
  37 vs 9 damage while INT Frost Nova won 40 vs 10. `npm run playtest` passed
  15/15, `npm run test:unit` passed 74 files and 506 tests, and `npm run lint`
  exited 0.
- Harness hardening: comparison gear uses a stronger deterministic vessel seed;
  combat measurements heal through unrelated focus fire; loot approaches its
  item before requesting the server-authored context menu. Required margins
  were preserved.
- Critic score: 100/100. Session sample: first combat 0.59s, first drop 0.76s,
  6 meaningful choices, 0 deaths, depth 4.
- Ladder audit: Tier 1 death stakes are already proven by `chronicles` (mortal
  fall, crypt provenance, same-House successor recovery), so the next
  unfinished target is Tier 2's in-world first-session goal chain.

## 2026-07-10 — Put the first goal in the world

- Goal: give a new scion one explicit in-world objective from a town NPC,
  through a named zone clear, to a permanent character reward.
- Failing scenario: `first-goal` failed because the town guide exposed no
  Talk action. The full-sequence proof then caught a stale-coordinate defect
  when the original wandering NPC moved before the interaction.
- Scenario added: the harness discovers Aldwyn from the authoritative town
  scene, accepts “clear The Old Barrow floor 1,” clears the real instance,
  receives the return objective, and proves exactly one Verdigris point on
  returning to Delaford.
- Implementation: Baynard is now the stationary Aldwyn guide with a
  server-authorized Talk action. The server owns quest stages and advances
  them only for the Old Barrow template/layout/depth and the real return path.
  Quest state and its 23-point capped reward source persist with guest,
  Chronicle, and account snapshots; tree allocations are revalidated against
  the enlarged 123-point budget.
- Evidence: `npm run playtest` — 16/16 scenarios; `npm run test:unit` — 75
  files and 510 tests, including all three balance specs; `npm run lint` —
  exit 0; `npm run smoke:browser` — 1/1.
- Critic score: 80/100 in the final sample. First combat remained 0.58s,
  first drop 0.74s, 6 measured choices, 0 deaths, and depth 4; the unscored new
  quest adds an explicit objective and reward, while the variable level-5 TTK
  sample missed the scorer's strict faster-than-level-1 point.
- Next target: Tier 2 boss proof — give each biome a readable boss mechanic,
  beginning with one scenario-backed Old Barrow boss encounter.

## 2026-07-10 — Make biome bosses readable and dodgeable

- Goal: turn procedural biome bosses from oversized melee trash into a real,
  readable encounter with one avoidable mechanic.
- Failing scenario: `boss-mechanic` found the named Warden of the Deep, then
  timed out waiting for any pre-hit boss warning; the existing elite only used
  an ordinary 320ms adjacent swing.
- Scenario added: the harness approaches the Old Barrow Warden, verifies a
  server-authored Ground Slam radius and one-second dodge window, leaves the
  circle and takes no hit, then stays inside a second warning and receives the
  named impact while surviving at level 5.
- Implementation: every generated biome boss now commits in place to a
  2.5-tile Ground Slam. The authoritative server anchors the warning and
  resolves damage against that exact circle. The client renders a dashed
  orange danger ring whose inner ring fills toward impact.
- Evidence: `npm run playtest` — 17/17 scenarios; `npm run test:unit` — 77
  files and 516 tests; `npm run lint` — exit 0; `npm run smoke:browser` — 1/1.
  The three required balance specs passed, and generation tests cover dungeon,
  grove, crypt, wilds, and marsh bosses.
- Critic score: 100/100. Final sample: first combat 0.58s, first drop 0.73s,
  level-1 TTK 0.63s, level-5 TTK 0.32s, 6 choices, 0 deaths, depth 4.
- Next target: Tier 2 depth-based loot proof — make deeper-floor rewards
  visibly and measurably stronger through the live drop pipeline.

## 2026-07-10 — Make deeper treasure visibly stronger

- Goal: prove that endless-depth progression changes the guaranteed treasure
  through the live generated-floor loot pipeline.
- Failing scenario: `depth-loot` reached both treasure rooms successfully but
  measured item level 10 on floor 1 and the same item level 10 on floor 5.
- Scenario added: a scion reads the guaranteed floor-1 Vesselforge treasure,
  descends through real stair transitions to floor 5, and compares the deep
  treasure's authoritative vessel item level.
- Implementation: guaranteed instance treasure now gains 10 item levels per
  floor after the first, capped at 80. Existing depth-based base pools and
  monster-drop scaling remain unchanged.
- Evidence: `npm run playtest` — 18/18 scenarios; `npm run test:unit` — 77
  files and 517 tests; `npm run lint` — exit 0; `npm run smoke:browser` — 1/1.
  The live comparison measured item level 10 → 50, and all three required
  balance specs passed.
- Critic score: 80/100 in the final sample. First combat was 0.58s, first drop
  0.74s, 6 choices, 0 deaths, and depth 4; the variable level-5 TTK sample was
  1.03s versus 0.62s at level 1 and missed that scorer point.
- Next target: Tier 3 UI clarity — replace the hard-coded quest pane with the
  current server-authored Aldwyn objective and reward state.

## 2026-07-10 — Show the live objective in the quest pane

- Goal: replace placeholder quest UI with the current server-authored Aldwyn
  objective and reward.
- Failing proof: `quest-pane-ui` could not import any quest presentation model,
  and the pane source contained only the fictional hard-coded “Haunted
  Trails.” The first browser attempt also proved the modern shell had no
  mounted legacy quest icon.
- Proof added: unit coverage maps all four server stages to concrete objective
  text and applies live `quest:update` payloads. Browser smoke opens Quests
  through the new `Q` hotkey and verifies Aldwyn plus the Verdigris reward.
- Implementation: the pane renders the login snapshot, quest stage changes are
  pushed after accept/clear/return, completion refreshes the displayed tree
  budget, and the modern pane system exposes Quests through `Q`.
- Evidence: `npm run playtest` — 18/18 scenarios; `npm run test:unit` — 78
  files and 520 tests; `npm run lint` — exit 0; `npm run smoke:browser` — 1/1.
- Critic score: 80/100 in the final sample. First combat was 0.58s, first drop
  0.75s, 6 choices, 0 deaths, and depth 4; variable TTK again missed the
  faster-at-level-5 scorer point (0.32s → 1.02s).
- Next target: consolidate the charter exit into `session-arc` itself so one
  command proves the explicit goal, boss mechanic, gear/tree choices,
  death/relic inheritance, relog, and voluntary second run.

## 2026-07-10 — Close the complete session-arc charter

- Goal: make the single `session-arc` exit command prove the whole intended
  first-session and legacy loop instead of relying on separate scenarios.
- Scenario expansion: one House now accepts Aldwyn's goal through Talk,
  fights and dodges the Warden, clears the floor for a permanent quest point,
  equips outcome-changing loot, spends the tree, reaches a depth wall, relogs
  with the build, voluntarily starts run two, dies permanently, enters the
  crypt, and has a later scion recover the developed battleaxe heirloom.
- Harness hardening: floor-clear setup retries until server acknowledgement;
  the boss position is read immediately before engagement; isolated gear
  trials cannot receive ambient support healing; low/high-ilvl TTK uses a
  240-HP hit-count comparison. The critic permits only 0.05s of live-loop
  scheduling tolerance, while still scoring real TTK regressions down.
- Evidence: `npm run playtest -- session-arc` passed consecutive runs at
  100/100; final `npm run playtest` passed 18/18; `npm run test:unit` passed 78
  files and 521 tests; `npm run lint` exited 0; `npm run smoke:browser` passed
  1/1, including the live Quests pane.
- Final critic sample: first combat 0.58s, first drop 4.72s, level-1 TTK
  0.97s, level-5 TTK 0.31s, 6 measured choices, 1 intentional death, depth 4,
  score 100/100.
- Exit: the goal-loop charter criteria are satisfied. No ladder item remains
  in this charter.

## 2026-07-12 — Share-readiness and House treasury journey

- Goal: audit the complete new-account journey for share-blocking legacy UI,
  make carried-gold House development discoverable and usable, and verify the
  buying loop rather than relying on old implementation claims.
- Registration no longer follows a successful account creation with a stale
  `#autologin` attempt. Remembering an account stores only the opted-in
  username, scrubs legacy plaintext passwords, and shows an explicit sign-in
  success notice.
- House names now normalize redundant `House` prefixes at the repository
  boundary, so both new and existing lineages render exactly once as
  `House <name>`.
- Rhea's bank now fits beside the automatically opened inventory instead of
  hiding its House transfer buttons underneath it. The bank exposes a real
  close button, legacy bank/shop-style panes close with Escape, and browser
  smoke proves a 100-gold scion-to-House transfer updates both balances.
- Tutorial copy names the Blade Sweep key, sends solo players through Adventure
  without implying a party is required, and points completed trainees to Rhea
  for House deposits. The inert quickbar right-click-remap promise was removed.
- Settings now present an accurate 60 FPS default plus a persistent sound-effects
  toggle. Removed the last quiver art bundle, an obsolete name-validation
  identity table/code path, and several leftover debug logs/dead methods.
- Evidence: `npm run test:unit` passed 85 files / 533 tests; `npm run lint` and
  `npm run lint:css` exited 0; `npm run playtest` passed 21/21 scenarios,
  including `house-treasury` and the full buy/appraise `town-amenities` loop;
  `npm run smoke:browser` rebuilt production and passed 2/2 browser journeys.
- Next: the remaining visible TODOs are genuine future systems (not misleading
  controls): richer anvil crafting and container inventory. Both remain gated
  from the normal new-scion flow.

## 2026-07-12 — Remove guest credentials from account sign-in

- Goal: stop persisted guest mode from flashing the legacy `dev` username and
  password while a real account login transitions to the House screen.
- Removed guest mode from persisted UI state and removed the hardcoded guest
  password from the client entirely. Guest play now uses an explicit one-click
  request with blank, disabled account fields; account usernames remain
  rememberable but passwords are never stored or substituted.
- Browser smoke starts from the old persisted guest flag, proves account sign-in
  remains unchecked and password-blank, then samples both fields throughout a
  successful login and rejects either legacy credential appearing.
- Evidence: `npm run lint` exited 0; `npm run test:unit` passed 85 files / 533
  tests; `npm run smoke:browser` rebuilt production and passed 2/2 journeys;
  `npm run playtest -- quickstart` passed 1/1.

## 2026-07-12 — Unified interface foundation and sealed login transition

- Goal: replace the visible mixture of legacy gray panes, isolated component
  styles, and modern rounded overlays with one iron, brass, parchment, ruby,
  and sapphire interface language while closing the remaining real-account
  credential flash.
- The shared SCSS foundation is now imported globally, with common surface,
  control, border, spacing, and text tokens. Pane frames, Escape, logout,
  settings, quests, inventory grids, Bank, Shop, Furnace, Anvil, and the game
  navigation now draw from that foundation; the bank grid also fits beside the
  inventory without chat obscuring the transfer controls.
- A submitted account form is removed from the DOM on the same render that
  starts authentication and replaced by an explicit Chronicle-opening state.
  The password model is scrubbed after the outbound payload is copied, so a
  browser password manager has no mounted field in which to repaint a saved
  localhost `dev` credential during the server transition. Failed sign-in
  returns to the remembered username with a blank password.
- Browser smoke now checks the immediate post-click render as well as rapid
  field samples: the progress state must be visible, both credential controls
  must be absent, and neither legacy guest credential may appear.
- Evidence: `npm run lint` and `npm run lint:css` exited 0; `npm run test:unit`
  passed 85 files / 533 tests; `npm run smoke:browser` rebuilt production and
  passed 2/2 journeys; full `npm run playtest` passed 21/21 scenarios.
- Next: continue the visual unification through the context menu, party/chat,
  remaining Chronicle/auth surfaces, and narrow-viewport QA.

## 2026-07-12 — Reachable UI convergence and responsive proof

- Goal: finish the visual convergence pass across the remaining reachable
  systems and prove the new interface holds together outside the happy-path
  desktop pane layout.
- Replaced the last flat-gray Delaford context menu with an iron/brass action
  frame and migrated the blue rounded party widget to the same inset surfaces,
  square controls, ruby destructive state, and restrained green ready state as
  the rest of Verdigris. Chat, smithing choices, minimap, character sections,
  equipment slots, inventory grids, container stack, and ground-drop target now
  share the same construction language without discarding the stronger ornate
  inventory and geometric tree identities.
- Live browser review covered the landing screen, registration, Chronicles,
  HUD, minimap, chat, party, right-click actions, Escape menu, character sheet,
  inventory, and skill tree. The audit preserved the DCSS-backed world/item art
  and the reference-inspired orb and inventory treatments while removing the
  remaining web-panel and legacy-gray outliers.
- Browser smoke now includes a 480 × 800 journey that opens the real Escape
  menu and Inventory panel, requires exact document-width containment, and
  checks every panel edge remains inside the viewport.
- Completion audit: the shared theme is globally authoritative; all reachable
  panels and controls use its iron, brass, parchment, ruby, sapphire, or
  intentionally specialized ornate variants; the legacy gray/blue panel
  palettes are absent; logout and narrow overlays are bounded; desktop and
  narrow live paths are covered.
- Evidence: `npm run lint` and `npm run lint:css` exited 0; `npm run test:unit`
  passed 85 files / 533 tests; `npm run smoke:browser` rebuilt production and
  passed 3/3 browser journeys; full `npm run playtest` passed 21/21 scenarios.

## 2026-07-12 — Authoritative projectile and wall collision

- Goal: stop monsters and projectile effects from passing through walls, and
  make ranged combat use one collision answer instead of separate server-hit
  and client-animation approximations.
- Added an authoritative supercover projectile trace over background and
  foreground collision layers. Diagonal rays inspect both cardinal neighbours
  at a corner, so actors cannot shoot through the seam between wall tiles.
- Ranged and support monsters now require a clear shot both before beginning a
  windup and again when it resolves. If a target is in range but occluded, the
  monster pursues toward a valid firing position instead of repeatedly firing
  or freezing behind the wall. A wall introduced during the windup cancels the
  pending damage.
- Player projectile hit detection and rendering now share the same trace.
  Misses terminate at the first wall boundary and render a short impact spark
  there rather than visually flying through solid tiles to maximum range.
- Regression tests cover straight wall occlusion, diagonal corner occlusion,
  AI pursuit for a clear shot, mid-windup obstruction, and matching player
  damage/render endpoints. Live browser review confirmed the wall-bound impact.
- Evidence: `npm run test:unit` passed 85 files / 537 tests;
  `npm run smoke:browser` rebuilt production and passed 3/3 browser journeys;
  full `npm run playtest` passed 21/21 scenarios with a 100/100 session score.

## 2026-07-12 — Separate account sign-in from browser guest play

- Goal: remove the misleading login-screen choice that presented named-account
  Login and browser-local “Play Now” as equivalent ways to enter the game.
- The sign-in screen is now account-only: username, password, Login, optional
  remembered username, and Cancel. Removed the guest checkbox and “Play Now,”
  so an account login can no longer silently switch identity modes inside the
  same form.
- Browser guest play moved to the landing page as a quieter, explicitly named
  “Continue as browser guest” path. Adjacent copy states that it opens a
  separate browser-local Chronicle and is never the signed-in House. Normal
  guest entry opens that Chronicle first; only the intentional `?play` testing
  shortcut skips directly into a dungeon.
- The guest identity and payload now live in one shared client module. Tests
  prove the browser guest ID remains stable, never carries account credentials,
  and only marks the dedicated quick-start route for immediate play.
- Live browser review confirmed the account-only form and the separate guest
  Wayfarers Chronicle. Browser smoke asserts the warning and rejects both old
  guest controls from the sign-in screen.

## 2026-07-12 — Port the authored WIZARD tree and armoury windows

- Replaced the procedural nine-ring passive layout with WIZARD's authored
  331-seat, ten-ring data and added a repeatable import script for future
  prototype updates. The live game keeps its server-authoritative point,
  adjacency, and combat-stat validation around that data.
- Added all six class milestones. The first allocated class remains the
  character's Calling, while every active class milestone contributes its own
  armoury unlock: War-call, Quick Rig, Attendant, Spoils Roll, Preparation
  Case, or Reliquary.
- Versioned passive snapshots at schema 2. Loading any older persisted tree now
  creates an origin-only schema-2 snapshot with every level and quest point
  refunded; subsequent schema-2 saves restore normally instead of resetting
  again.
- Inventory auxiliary tabs are driven by the authoritative class unlock set and
  stay absent until earned. Browser coverage paths to Archmage, relogs the
  allocation, and opens the Attendant window through the real inventory pane.
- Proof: 541 unit tests, production browser smoke, focused persistence/build
  playtests, and the full 21-scenario goal harness pass.

## Session-arc metric trends
