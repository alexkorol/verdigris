# Native reconstitution handoff

## 2026-08-15 — Milestones A–D first runnable slice

- Repository was synchronized to `origin/master` (`882dd81`) and work moved to
  `codex/native-reconstitution`.
- The browser game remains intact as historical reference.
- Product authority, open decisions, WIZARD Arcane Lattice evidence, legacy
  matrix/denylist, canonical `AGENTS.md`, sprint map, and C++ ADR are complete.
- `native/` is a dependency-free C++20 workspace with a fixed-step command/event
  simulation. It proves House and Scion creation, shared player/monster stats,
  movement, melee, damage/death, generated item and trophy drops, pickup/equip,
  extraction, loss and relic candidacy, House-owned route/branch progression,
  and an external seasonal objective/reward.
- `native/client/main.cpp` is a first runnable client: Win32 opens a native
  placeholder-shape window with WASD, mouse actions, Space dash, pickup/equip,
  and extraction controls; `--headless` provides a self-terminating smoke run.
- The core test executable covers the eleven requested architectural behaviors.
- Explicit `platform/`, `renderer/`, `networking/`, `persistence/`, and
  `content/` seams are documented without coupling them into the simulation.
- WIZARD integration intent is now explicit: orbs and Splash feed the renderer
  or menu presentation, Brands & Bonds/inventory feeds the item/UI path, and
  Cartographer is a candidate deterministic map-content adapter.
- The Claude demo source and 22 external PNG plates are now inventoried in
  [`CLAUDE_DEMO_ASSET_INTAKE.md`](CLAUDE_DEMO_ASSET_INTAKE.md). The binaries
  remain outside the checkout pending asset provenance, size, and packaging
  approval.
- The incomplete product checklist is recorded in
  [`VERDIGRIS_FEATURE_CHECKLIST.md`](../product/VERDIGRIS_FEATURE_CHECKLIST.md),
  with economy, Legends, branch-length, travel-risk, and UI-setting questions
  promoted into `OPEN_DECISIONS.md`.

## Next exact steps

1. Run a manual Win32 play pass and capture control/feel notes.
2. Decide whether the next renderer experiment uses the existing Canvas 2.5D
   reference ideas or a focused native billboard layer.
3. Keep networking, persistence, complete magic, and production art out of the
   core until the first playable loop has been evaluated.
