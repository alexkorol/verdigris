# Native reconstitution handoff

## 2026-08-15 (latest) — Orchestration program active

- The program is now coordinated through `orchestration/` (protocol, state,
  decisions, task specs). Claude/Fable is architect+reviewer; the Codex
  coordinator with Luna workers implements. Read
  `orchestration/PROTOCOL.md` first.
- Wave 1 READY: TASK-0001 (native Legends records), TASK-0002 (build/CI
  hardening), TASK-0003 (slice verification harness). DRAFT: TASK-0004
  (client control pass per decision D-007), TASK-0005 (legacy audit).
- `prototypes/founding-slice/` is a committed, verified browser feel-lab
  ("Founding of a House"): serve the folder statically and open
  `index.html`, or rebuild via `node build.mjs`. It answers camera/combat/
  founding presentation questions and has no architectural authority.

## 2026-08-15 (later) — Milestone E first visual pass and a build fix

- Fixed a real Milestone D defect: `build.ps1` never defined
  `VERDIGRIS_NATIVE_WINDOWS`, so the "windowed" client silently compiled the
  console fallback and exited immediately. The define is now passed, the entry
  point is a standard `main()` (console subsystem keeps `--headless` stdout
  working), and `NOMINMAX` protects the std algorithms.
- `native/client/main.cpp` now carries the Milestone E visual foundation:
  an adjustable 2.5D camera (wheel zoom, PgUp/PgDn pitch, -/= perspective,
  Home reset), back-to-front depth sorting, contact shadows, a projected
  ground grid and extraction pad, billboard actors with enemy life bars,
  client-side loot scatter around kill sites, and procedural event-driven
  effects (swing arcs, impact flashes, death rings, dust, loot sparkles),
  all double-buffered.
- Verified end to end on Windows: MSVC build clean, the eleven core tests and
  the legacy denylist gate pass, `--headless` completes the extraction loop,
  and a driven input pass (PostMessage WASD/LMB/P/E/X against the live window,
  PrintWindow captures) shows the fight, drops, route unlocks, and extraction
  rendering correctly.

## 2026-08-15 — Milestones A–D first runnable slice

- Repository was synchronized to `origin/master` (`882dd81`) and work moved to
  `codex/native-reconstitution`.
- The browser game remains intact as historical reference.
- Product authority, open decisions, WIZARD Arcane Lattice evidence, legacy
  matrix/denylist, canonical `AGENTS.md`, sprint map, and C++ ADR are complete.
- `native/` is a dependency-free C++20 workspace with a fixed-step command/event
  simulation. It proves House and Scion creation, shared player/monster stats,
  movement, melee, damage/death, generated item and trophy drops, pickup/equip,
  extraction, loss and relic candidacy, House-owned route/branch progression,
  and an external seasonal objective/reward.
- `native/client/main.cpp` is a first runnable client: Win32 opens a native
  placeholder-shape window with WASD, mouse actions, Space dash, pickup/equip,
  and extraction controls; `--headless` provides a self-terminating smoke run.
- The core test executable covers the eleven requested architectural behaviors.
- Explicit `platform/`, `renderer/`, `networking/`, `persistence/`, and
  `content/` seams are documented without coupling them into the simulation.
- WIZARD integration intent is now explicit: orbs and Splash feed the renderer
  or menu presentation, Brands & Bonds/inventory feeds the item/UI path, and
  Cartographer is a candidate deterministic map-content adapter.
- The Claude demo source and 22 external PNG plates are now inventoried in
  [`CLAUDE_DEMO_ASSET_INTAKE.md`](CLAUDE_DEMO_ASSET_INTAKE.md). The binaries
  remain outside the checkout pending asset provenance, size, and packaging
  approval.
- The incomplete product checklist is recorded in
  [`VERDIGRIS_FEATURE_CHECKLIST.md`](../product/VERDIGRIS_FEATURE_CHECKLIST.md),
  with economy, Legends, branch-length, travel-risk, and UI-setting questions
  promoted into `OPEN_DECISIONS.md`.

## Next exact steps

1. Run a manual Win32 play pass and capture control/feel notes.
2. Decide whether the next renderer experiment uses the existing Canvas 2.5D
   reference ideas or a focused native billboard layer.
3. Keep networking, persistence, complete magic, and production art out of the
   core until the first playable loop has been evaluated.
